# Uriel Alvarado - Ejercicio de conflicto

Hello, my name is Uriel Alvarado, and I am a student at IMSSB. I am currently learning about GitHub and its functionalities.

## My GitHub Journey

I am excited to explore the world of version control and collaboration using GitHub. I plan to use GitHub for:

- **Personal Projects**: Managing my own coding projects and tracking changes.
- **Collaborative Learning**: Working with classmates on group assignments and sharing code.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Eventually contributing to open-source projects to learn from others and give back to the community.
